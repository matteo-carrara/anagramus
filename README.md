# What is an anagram?
Regarding this software, an anagram is defined as follows:
an anagram of a word or a phrase T is a permutation of all characters of T (excluding spaces), that contains one or more words from a specific language AND uses every single character of T (so that the anagram can be reversed back to the original form).

To check if a word/combination of words is an anagram of another word/set of words, there is included a script "is_anagram" to check it.
